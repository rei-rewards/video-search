name: Advanced Multi-Spreadsheet Search Tool with Enhanced Search Experience
description: |
  A React-based web application that provides a superior search experience across multiple spreadsheet files (Excel, CSV, TSV). It features intelligent parsing, advanced search capabilities, real-time filtering, data enrichment through tagging, and optional cloud integration. The app prioritizes performance, accessibility, and user experience to handle large datasets efficiently while providing intuitive data exploration tools.

context:
  # Frontend Stack
  - Use React 18+ with TypeScript for type safety and better development experience
  - Use Material UI or Tailwind CSS for consistent, accessible design system
  - Implement React Query/TanStack Query for efficient data fetching and caching
  - Use Zustand or Redux Toolkit for state management of search state and user preferences

  # File Processing & Search
  - Use SheetJS (xlsx) to parse Excel files (.xlsx, .xls) into JSON
  - Use PapaParse for CSV/TSV file parsing with robust error handling
  - Use Fuse.js for fuzzy search with configurable thresholds and weighted fields
  - Implement search debouncing (300ms) to optimize performance
  - Support search operators: exact quotes, exclude terms (-term), field-specific (column:value)

  # Data Management & Storage
  - Store parsed data in IndexedDB for offline access and faster subsequent loads
  - Cache search indices in memory with LRU eviction for large datasets
  - Use localStorage for user preferences, recent searches, and quick tags
  - Optional backend integration: Firebase, Supabase, or custom API for collaboration
  - Implement data compression for large spreadsheets (JSON.stringify + LZ compression)

  # Search Experience Features
  - Real-time search with instant results (< 100ms for most queries)
  - Advanced filters: date ranges, numeric ranges, boolean columns, custom criteria
  - Search highlighting with context snippets
  - Search history and saved searches functionality
  - Auto-complete suggestions based on column values and previous searches
  - Search across specific columns or all columns
  - Support for regex patterns in advanced mode

  # Data Enrichment & Tagging
  - Row-level tagging system with color-coded tags
  - Bulk tagging operations for filtered results
  - Tag autocomplete and suggestion system
  - Custom metadata fields that become searchable
  - Import/export tag configurations

  # Performance Optimizations
  - Virtual scrolling for large datasets (10,000+ rows)
  - Progressive loading of search results with pagination
  - Web Workers for heavy parsing and search operations
  - Memoized search results and intelligent caching
  - Background processing of file uploads

  # User Interface & Experience
  - Responsive design that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop
  - Keyboard shortcuts for power users (Ctrl+K for search, Ctrl+F for find-in-page)
  - Drag-and-drop file upload with progress indicators
  - Split-pane view: file browser + search results
  - Customizable column visibility and ordering
  - Export filtered results to Excel, CSV, or JSON
  - Print-friendly views for reports

  # Error Handling & Validation
  - Graceful handling of corrupted or unsupported files
  - User-friendly error messages with suggested fixes
  - File size limits with clear warnings (e.g., 50MB default)
  - Data validation for imported spreadsheets
  - Offline mode with sync capabilities when connection restored

  # Accessibility & Internationalization
  - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for screen readers and keyboard navigation
  - ARIA labels for search results and interactive elements
  - High contrast mode support
  - Internationalization support with react-i18next
  - Configurable font sizes and themes

  # Cloud Integration (Optional)
  - Microsoft Graph API for OneDrive/SharePoint integration
  - Google Drive API for Google Sheets access
  - Dropbox API for cloud file access
  - Real-time collaboration features with conflict resolution
  - Version history and change tracking

goals:
  # Core Search Functionality
  - Provide sub-second search results across multiple large spreadsheets
  - Support complex search queries with Boolean operators and field-specific searches
  - Enable fuzzy matching with configurable similarity thresholds
  - Implement search result ranking based on relevance and user behavior

  # Data Enhancement
  - Allow users to enrich data with tags, notes, and custom metadata
  - Make all enrichments fully searchable and filterable
  - Support bulk operations for efficient data management
  - Enable collaborative tagging and data curation

  # Performance & Scalability
  - Handle datasets with 100,000+ rows without performance degradation
  - Optimize memory usage for large files through streaming and chunking
  - Provide progress feedback for long-running operations
  - Support concurrent file processing

  # User Experience
  - Create an intuitive interface that requires minimal learning curve
  - Provide powerful features for advanced users without cluttering the basic interface
  - Support workflow automation through saved searches and filters
  - Enable seamless collaboration and data sharing

  # Integration & Extensibility
  - Support various file formats (Excel, CSV, TSV, Google Sheets)
  - Provide API endpoints for programmatic access
  - Enable plugin architecture for custom data processors
  - Support integration with popular productivity tools

  # Data Security & Privacy
  - Implement client-side encryption for sensitive data
  - Provide granular sharing controls
  - Support data export and deletion (GDPR compliance)
  - Enable audit trails for data access and modifications
